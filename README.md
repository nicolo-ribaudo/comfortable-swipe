## Gesture Configurations

The default configuration file is located at `~/.config/comfortable-swipe.conf`.
Comfortable swipe makes use of **keyboard shortcuts** to perform swipes, through `xdotool`.

Set a property directly with:

```
comfortable-swipe <PROPERTY> [=] <VALUE>
```

Or edit the configuration file manually:

```
gedit ~/.config/comfortable-swipe.conf
```

After editing, make sure to restart with `comfortable-swipe start`.

> **Warning**: For v1.1.0 below, the configuration file is located at
> `/usr/local/share/comfortable-swipe/comfortable-swipe.conf`

> **Note**: You can locate the absolute path to your configuration by running: `comfortable-swipe config path`

### Keystrokes

Taken from `man xdotool`:

> Type a given keystroke. Examples being "alt+r", "Control_L+J",
> "ctrl+alt+n", "BackSpace".
>
> Generally, any valid X Keysym string will work. Multiple keys are
> separated by '+'. Aliases exist for "alt", "ctrl", "shift",
> "super", and "meta" which all map to Foo_L, such as Alt_L and
> Control_L, etc.
>
> In cases where your keyboard doesn't actually have the key you want
> to type, xdotool will automatically find an unused keycode and use
> that to type the key.

Refer to https://www.linux.org/threads/xdotool-keyboard.10528/ for a complete list of keycodes you can use.

## Known Issues: Pop!_OS and Ubuntu 20.04+

Pop!_OS and Ubuntu 20.04+ may be sensitive to capitalization  (#76, #82). Make sure to capitalize every first letter:

```bash
# Pop!_OS or Ubuntu
comfortable-swipe up3 = Super+Ctrl+Down
comfortable-swipe down3 = Super+Ctrl+Up
```

   ```

1. Toggle minimize

   ```bash
   comfortable-swipe down3 = super+Down
   ```

## Mouse Gestures (Experimental)

You can also play around with mouse gestures during swipe.
This enables certain mouse behaviour to trigger along with a 3/4-finger swipe.

Keys:

- mouse3 - for 3-finger mouse gestures
- mouse4 - for 4-finger mosue gestures
- hold3 (deprecated) - old equivalent of mouse3
- hold4 (deprecated) - old equivalent of mouse4

Possible Values:

- button1 - left click
- button2 - middle click
- button3 - right click
- button4 - wheel up (experimental)
- button5 - wheel down (experimental)
- move - just move the mouse cursor while fingers are down
- scroll - 3/4 finger natural scroll (no acceleration, very experimental)
- scroll_reverse - 3/4 finger reverse scroll (no acceleration, very experimental)

> **Tip**: You can clear mouse gestures by setting them blank
>
> ```
> comfortable-swipe mouse3 =
> comfortable-swipe mouse4 =
> ```

Examples:

✔️ swipes OK
⭕ swipes DISABLED

- 3/4-finger drag ⭕

  ```bash
  comfortable-swipe mouse3 = button1
  comfortable-swipe mouse4 = button1
  ```

  You can also use `button2` for middle click and `button3` for right click.

- 3/4-finger natural scroll ⭕

  ```bash
  comfortable-swipe mouse3 = scroll
  comfortable-swipe mouse4 = scroll
  ```

- 3/4-finger reverse scroll ⭕

  ```bash
  comfortable-swipe mouse3 = scroll_reverse
  comfortable-swipe mouse4 = scroll_reverse
  ```

- Move 3/4-fingers with the cursor ✔️

  ```bash
  comfortable-swipe mouse3 = move
  comfortable-swipe mouse4 = move
  ```

> **Warning**: Some mouse configuration will **disable up/left/right/down behavior** to avoid gesture conflicts. The logic of this will be improved in the future.

## Debugging

You can check your touchpad driver by running

```bash
comfortable-swipe debug
```

This is an alias of `libinput debug-events`. This logs all gestures you make on your touchpad, along with other input-based events that can be captured by libinput.

A working swipe gesture will show the following:

```bash
$ comfortable-swipe debug
...
-event9   DEVICE_ADDED     TouchPad                     seat0 default group7  cap:pg  size 70x50mm tap(dl off) left scroll-nat scroll-2fg-edge click-buttonareas-clickfinger dwt-on

event9   GESTURE_SWIPE_UPDATE  +2.08s  3 -4.61/ 2.08 (-12.47/ 5.62 unaccelerated)
event9   GESTURE_SWIPE_UPDATE  +2.09s  3 -4.49/ 1.53 (-12.14/ 4.12 unaccelerated)
event9   GESTURE_SWIPE_UPDATE  +2.09s  3 -4.01/ 1.25 (-10.83/ 3.37 unaccelerated)
event9   GESTURE_SWIPE_UPDATE  +2.10s  3 -4.13/ 0.42 (-11.15/ 1.12 unaccelerated)
event9   GESTURE_SWIPE_END  +2.11s     3
...
```

If you can see `GESTURE_SWIPE_XXX` in your output, that means your touchpad supports multi-touch swipe gestures.

## FAQ: Can I run a _shell command_ instead of a keystroke?

**Answer 1**: _Unfortunately **NO**..._

For the following reasons:

1.  We want prioritize "comfort" over functionality, which we deliver through performance in our negligible-overhead implementation (that's why C++)
1.  There are other gesture libraries that already do this properly (eg. [libinput gestures](https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures), [Fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma)), we don't want to be a clone of them
1.  Running a new shell command with unpredictable process time will break our unthreaded optimizations (unlike native keystrokes)

That's why it's not possible... or not?

**Answer 2**: _... but actually **IT'S POSSIBLE**!_

Although we don't provide this out of the box in our config, this can definitely be
done with the default bash tools.

## Hack: Shell command on swipe

Running shell commands our **NOT** part of the core features of comfortable-swipe,
but through the default bash tools you can _mimic_ this functionality via our program output.

<details>
<summary> <b>Use Case</b>: <i>"I want to run <code>gnome-terminal</code> if I swipe up with 3 fingers."</i>
</summary>

1. Attach the program to the shell:

   ```bash
   comfortable-swipe start --attach
   ```

   Verify it outputs when you swipe left, left, up, right, up with 3 fingers:

   ```bash
   $ comfortable-swipe start --attach
   SWIPE left3
   SWIPE left3
   SWIPE up3
   SWIPE right3
   SWIPE up3
   ...
   ```

1. Filter out the wanted gesture with `grep`.

   In our case, we want 3-finger swipe up which is "SWIPE up3":

   ```bash
   $ comfortable-swipe start --attach | grep --line-buffered "SWIPE up3"
   SWIPE up3
   SWIPE up3
   ...
   ```

   > **Note**: The flag `--line-buffered` ensures the output prints line-by-line.

1. Now we can execute our shell command with `xargs`.

   So if we want "SWIPE up3" to open the terminal,

   ```bash
   comfortable-swipe start --attach | grep "SWIPE up3" --line-buffered | xargs -I@ gnome-terminal
   ```

   > **Note**: The flag `-I@` in xargs substitutes the line "SWIPE xxx" to the charatcter "@", which you can use for your program.

1. _Bonus_: Add to autostart

   Open our autostart file:

   ```bash
   gedit "$(comfortable-swipe autostart path)"
   ```

   Tweak the `Exec` section:

   ```ini
   [Desktop Entry]
   Type=Application
   Exec=comfortable-swipe start
   Name=Comfortable Swipe
   Comment=Comfortable 3/4-finger touchpad gestures
   Hidden=false
   NoDisplay=false
   X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
   ```

   To:

   ```ini
   [Desktop Entry]
   Type=Application
   Exec=comfortable-swipe start --attach | grep "SWIPE up3" --line-buffered | xargs -I@ gnome-terminal
   Name=Comfortable Swipe
   Comment=Comfortable 3/4-finger touchpad gestures
   Hidden=false
   NoDisplay=false
   X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
   ```

1. Log out and log back in.
   You should now be able to run your custom shell commands on startup.

1. _Bonus_: Use `--bare` instead of `--attach` to NOT run keystrokes while swiping

   ```bash
   comfortable-swipe start --bare | grep "SWIPE up3" --line-buffered | xargs -I@ gnome-terminal
   ```

1. _Bonus_: You can pipe multiple gestures with `tee`:

   ```bash
   comfortable-swipe start --attach | \
   tee >(grep "SWIPE left3"  --line-buffered | xargs -I@ <COMMAND>) | \
   tee >(grep "SWIPE left4"  --line-buffered | xargs -I@ <COMMAND>) | \
   tee >(grep "SWIPE right3" --line-buffered | xargs -I@ <COMMAND>) | \
   tee >(grep "SWIPE right4" --line-buffered | xargs -I@ <COMMAND>) | \
   tee >(grep "SWIPE up3"    --line-buffered | xargs -I@ <COMMAND>) | \
   tee >(grep "SWIPE up4"    --line-buffered | xargs -I@ <COMMAND>) | \
   tee >(grep "SWIPE down3"  --line-buffered | xargs -I@ <COMMAND>) | \
   tee >(grep "SWIPE down4"  --line-buffered | xargs -I@ <COMMAND>)
   ```

   Substitute `<COMMAND>` with the shell command of your choice.
